              <header class="header">JS Generative Art </header>
              <P>I have also experimented with using JavaScript to create rule based generative art.
                 Using Canvas Sketch, I have played around with manipulating different shapes, colours and compositions.
                 The ability to see changes to your work immediately is exciting, experimenting with different variables to create unexpected results. </p>
              
              <p>The products of this type of computational art are more structured than others
                 I have experimented with, but there was still room for playfullness.
                 I would like to explore more, utilising different inputs to control the variables and the output images shown on screen.</p>
  
              <p>Below is a project of mine that uses a control panel to let the user create new and unique images within the browser.
                To access and play with this project use this link,</p>
