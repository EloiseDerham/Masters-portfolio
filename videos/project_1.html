              <p>In my final year of university, I started to have an interest in computational art, 
                we hadnâ€™t been told or taught about it so I took matters into my own hands and 
                tried to figure out a way I could incorporate it into my dissertation.</p>
              <p>I studied computer science with AI so the logical route was to investigate Generative Adversarial Networks and how they can be used to generate unique images and art.
                 I was unaware at the time, that I completed my dissertation at the beginning of the AI art boom. 
                 With sites such as Dall-e and chatGPT now common household names.</p>
                 <p>
                    In my project I used a DCGAN with a dataset of cityscape paintings to generate unique pieces of artwork. 
                    Below are some examples of the final pieces created.
                 </p>
                 <p>As well as the final products from my project I have attached my dissertation<a href="./files/Generative art using DCGANs.pdf" target="_blank"> here. </a></p>
