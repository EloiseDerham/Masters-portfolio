              <p>Below are pieces I created during the Roundhouse Young Creatives VJing course. 
                We experimented with the MadMapper software to create new visuals,
                 edit existing videos, and project them in collaboration with live music. </p>
              <p>I really enjoyed being able to edit and distort existing videos in connection with music. 
                  I found the process similar to collaging, collecting and arranging different forms of media with different shapes , 
                  patterns and colours.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately due to my computer's processing power, some of the videos below are lagging.
                 With a higher processing speed these would be a lot smoother.</p>  

              <p>Please enjoy the pieces with music by clicking the sound icon in the corner.</p>
