              <p>In my final year of university, I started to have an interest in computational art.
                 We hadnâ€™t been told or taught about it so I took matters into my own hands and tried to figure out a way I could
                  incorporate it into my dissertation.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>I studied Computer Science with AI so the logical route was to investigate Generative Adversarial Networks and how they can be used to generate unique images and art. I was unaware at the time that I was completing my dissertation at the beginning of the AI art boom,
                         with sites such as DALL-E and chatGPT now becoming common household names.</p>
                    
                <p>In my project I used a DCGAN with a dataset of cityscape paintings to generate unique pieces of artwork. </p>
