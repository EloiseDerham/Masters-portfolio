              <p>Another form of computational art I have explored is glitch art.
                 I experimented with a couple of different glitching methods which I have displayed below.</p>

              <p>The first set of images were created an app called Glitch Lab, an accessible interface that gives the user tools to distort,
                 deconstruct and reconstruct any image they choose to input. </p>
              <p>I really like how far from the original this app lets you glitch your images,
                 distorting the pixels into unrecognisable images. The original digital material is recycled, never permanent- pixels become a medium to discover something new in something familiar. </p>
              
              
              <div>
              <div class="row">
                <div class="column">
                    <img src="./images/Glitch_art_1.png" style="width:100%;max-width:1000px" >
                </div>
                <div class="column">
                    <img src="./images/Glitch_art_2.png" style="width:100%;max-width:1000px" >
                </div>
                <div class="column">
                    <img src="./images/Glitch_art_3.png" style="width:100%;max-width:1000px" >
                </div>
              </div>
              <p>Using the app had limits, and I wanted to explore this medium without being bound by the rules of an application. The images below are the result of this exploration, made by taking the source code for the given image and scrambling, 
                deleting, and rewriting it in a text editor.  </p>
                <p>The original images are more recognisable in these distortions than the app generated ones,
                  which lends a technological ethereality to them (though I prefer the absurdism of the more ‘glitchy’ outputs of the app).</p>
