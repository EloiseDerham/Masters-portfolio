              <p>I took part in the projection mapping course at the Roundhouse,
                 which focused on using MadMapper to project content onto different shapes and surfaces.
                 This is an interesting way to explore projection as the object you choose as a canvas can have a big effect on the content you decide to use.</p>
                
              <p> I really enjoyed playing with narrative within my videos and using the objects as direct links to the content. 
                  I also observed how the effects of patterns and textures I had discovered in the VJing course were altered when displayed on different objects and confined to limited spaces.</p>
